title: Internship, IPM Institute For Research in Fundamental Sciences
duration: June 2023 - September 2023
excerpt: |
  During my internship at IPM Institute For Research in Fundamental Sciences, I was involved in the following key activities:
  - Developed an intelligent agent for the game "Soccer Stars" to compete with human players.
  - Focused on key areas including computer vision, evolutionary algorithms, and physics simulation.
  - Utilized computer vision techniques for accurate perception and interpretation of game visuals.
  - Integrated a custom-trained YOLOv5 model for object detection.
  - Employed evolutionary algorithms for strategic decision-making and action execution.
  - Implemented physics simulation to replicate and calculate in-game physics interactions.
  - Optimized physics parameters via genetic algorithms for accurate in-game simulation.
